## Oauth 2.0 TLDR;
- Oauth2 is an authorization protocol used to grant access to a resource (like a service or API) without sharing credentials.
- For example a spotify TUI client, would use Oauth2 to request access to the spotify API, then use that token to access the spotify API on your behalf, without having to share your credentials. This will also be limited to the scopes that you have allowed the client to access.
