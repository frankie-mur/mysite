# Background
A while back I read an article about the conecpt of "No broken windows", at first it may seem odd, what does it mean to have no broken windows?
It is a old [crimenology theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) 
Simply put The Broken Window Theory suggests that visible signs of disorder, like broken windows or graffiti, encourage more crime. Keeping areas clean and well-maintained helps prevent this by promoting order and discouraging bad behavior.

# What does this have to do with Code?
The Broken Window Theory in coding suggests that what may seem like small issues in codeâ€”like messy formatting, minor bugs, temporary workarounds, lead to larger problems over time. If these "broken windows" aren't fixed, they signal to programmers that low-quality code is acceptable, which can snowball into more serious technical debt. Keeping the codebase clean and addressing issues early on helps maintain overall code quality and will prevents bigger problems down the road.

## This also helps in life..
You can even take this pricipal into your daily lives, showing a willingness a pride to prevent broken windows.

# Summary
Wanted to keep this one short and sweet, try and to prevent broken windows in your life, abeit in coding and in general. A good piece of adive I recieved was to always leave a codebase a little bit better off then when you started working with it, and remember **No Broken Windows**
