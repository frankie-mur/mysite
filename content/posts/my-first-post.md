This is my first Hugo site it seems pretty cool....
- Set up theme [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite), and menu bar along with tags and a fuzzy search.
- I like how Hugo is written in Go, very interested in learning more about it (possibly Contribute to it?), anyways looking forward to making more posts. Kaizen!
