This is my first Hugo site it seems pretty cool....
I have sest up [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite) theme and menu bar along with tags and a fuzzy search.
I hear Hugo is written in Go, Im interested in learning more about it (possibly Contribute to it?) anyways looking forward to making more posts. Kaizen!
